- Modified behaviour of search, can now be used in conjunction with
  other flags, but indexes now always start from 0 rather than than 
  being indexed the same as a default view, the same as --importance
  and --group flags.
- Added --nocol no colour flag just incase you want to pipe to less or
  something.
- modified notes are now checked for ':D' and todays date is inserted.
