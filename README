Tnote README file
=================

INTRO
~~~~~

Tnote aims to be a sticky style note taking application for the terminal, making it easy and quick to take, view and search notes from the terminal.
Its written in python, in fact I wrote it to learn python and just happened to turn in to somthing people might find useful.
Version 0.2 is basically a rewrite adding options for grouping notes and colours.
